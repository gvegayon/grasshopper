The goal of grasshopper is to ...

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(grasshopper)

# Simulating a patch of grass
set.seed(111)
x <- grasshopper:::sim_grass_joint(area = 700)
image(x$grass, col = c("white", "darkgreen"))
```

```{r example2, cache=TRUE}
ans <- grasshopper(
  xmax = 200,
  ymax = 200,
  area = 200, len = 20,
  nsim = 1e4, # number of grass simulations
  subsim = 1e4, # number of times that we make the bug jump in each sim
  ncpus = 4, ring = .99
  )

# Plotting the best and the worse
plot_seq(ans)
```
